<h1>Technology and Education</h1>
    <p>Technology has become more and more integrated to classroom. Some people believes that technology is making education better and more efficient. However, I found out through my research that technology will make education worse by not having the benefits of the traditional classroom and introduces more problems that overwhelm the benefits of it. </p>
    <p>There are multiple benefits of traditional classroom model, but the most important thing is human interactions between teacher and students. According to University of Virginia Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning, positive effects of having teacher-student interaction in classroom includes positive climate, teacher sensitivity, regard for student prospectives, and productivity (UVa CASTL). Also in a study done by Naimah Hanum on the importance of classroom interaction, she shows that interaction is needed in the classroom activity since it helps the teaching and learning process run smoothly and it can increase learners’ communicative skills (Hanum). She also shows that interaction between students can significantly improve the efficiency of learning (Hanum). All of these researches suggests that classroom interaction is vital to the education process. But with technology invading into classroom, this benefit is lost. </p>
    <p>Admittedly, technologies can be helpful in the learning process. They help teachers doing duplicated works and give access of learning materials to more people. But increasingly, we are seeing a worrisome trend of technology, especially robots, replacing teachers as educators that, if no prevention actions are made, can lead to devastating consequences. Most technology requires a screen to display its content, and with too much screen time comes detrimental effects to the growth and development of young children, as it’s been correlated to childhood obesity, sleep disturbance, and learning, attention, and social problems (Linn et. al). Linn, Almon, and Levin highlights the danger of too much screen time on the minds of children and advocates to reduce screen time as the health and development of young children depends on it (Linn et. al). Certain screen content has also been known to diminish creativity, desensitization to violence, and lack of empathy for victims of violence, which are just some more examples of potential social issues (Linn et. al). </p>
    <p>There’s also the problem of the loss of human interaction between teacher and students. According to the research by McCreery and Tettegah on the relationship between emotions and technology in education and how learning one affects learning the other, online education can interfere with the natural process of learning emotions (McCreery). Online learning can also induce frustration, which is caused by the lack of personal human comfort (McCreery). And the compliments show on the computer screen is not as effective as compliments from a human teacher (McCreery). Research by Park, Kim, and Del Pobil also shows that an actual human teacher is better perceived than a robot instructor when receiving feedback (Park, et.al). Teachers and students form a special connection that is critical to the efficiency of the learning process(Park, et.al). If such connection is stripped from classroom, students would be less willing and less able to learn. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, the problem of force-fed education and information overload is inevitable. Highest efficiency is not always the best for education, since we are facing individuals rather than objects on the assembly line. Education is not only about learning knowledge, but also about the process of learning knowledge as well as other aspects like getting along with others. Robots do not have feelings and thus don’t have the ability to teach the skills necessary for social life. What’s more, forcing students to learn is inefficient, since we all need time to zone out and reflect on our life. But for robots, efficiency is top priority, and it is highly likely that they would mistaken memorization for learning and just force-fed the knowledge to students. They would focuses on the advancement of technology so much that the well-being of students is lost. </p>
    <p>But more importantly, with the development of artificial intelligence and robotics, we can see in the near future where the learning process is completely controlled by AI, while students are separated from each other. In foreseeable future, loss of individuality and personality, as well as the loss of social identity, can be disastrous to our human civilization. In our video, the only “teacher” that the student can interact with is the robot. The student does not have interaction with real human beings. The student also loses their social identity. They are not learners or students, rather, they are referred to as “subject”. Instead of pursuing their interests, the robot just force-fed a preset study schedule to the subject. Learning becomes a job, or even a torture, rather than having fun. Instead of become building blocks of civilization, these students would become tools of AI and robots for their own use. This is truly something to worry about, if we do not make any actions to stop the trend. </p>
    <p>To conclude, the advancement of technology has widened the gap between teacher and student, limiting a personal and social interaction necessary for growth and development among young children. And there can be even more worrisome trends if we don’t step in and stop technology from doing too much.
